## 2026-05-27 — Session 13

**Fix nav position on project pages after title removal**

- `.project-header` changed from `justify-content: space-between` to `justify-content: flex-end` so the nav sits at the same right edge as on the homepage.

---

## 2026-05-27 — Session 12

**Remove gallery name from top-left of all project pages**

- Removed `<span class="project-header-title">` from all 5 project pages (`people-of-telegraph.html`, `family.html`, `studio-portraits.html`, `self-portraits.html`, `streets-in-color.html`). Nav (Gallery / About / Contact) remains.

**Add about portrait to About page**

- Renamed `images/about portrait.png` → `images/about-portrait.png` (dash convention).
- Updated `about.html` portrait `src` to `images/about-portrait.png`; removed placeholder span.

## 2026-05-27 — Session 11

**Align project header title with photo names and intro text**

- Added `margin-left: calc(var(--label-col) + 24px)` to `.project-header-title` so the gallery name in the top-left shares the same left edge as the intro paragraph and the photo images.
- Added `margin-left: 0` reset for `.project-header-title` in the ≤720px mobile breakpoint.

## 2026-05-27 — Session 10

**Fix intro-text alignment fragility; update CLAUDE.md**

- Added `--label-col: 200px` to `:root` in `styles.css`. `.num-row` now uses `var(--label-col)` for its grid column, and `.project-body > p:first-child` uses `calc(var(--label-col) + 24px)` for its indent. Changing the label column width now requires editing only one token.
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` to match what's actually built: Archivo is the font in use (Space Grotesk open decision noted), homepage logo is Archivo 52px (not Bebas Neue 120px), project pages use numbered-sequence layout (not hero/figure blocks), `--label-col` documented as the coupling token, current 5 projects listed.

## 2026-05-27 — Session 9

**Revised gallery intro text across all 5 project pages**

- People of Telegraph: sharpened from hedging "attempt to slow down" to "a record of looking."
- Family: led with the core idea ("Familiarity makes people invisible") instead of burying it.
- Studio Portraits: tightened opening; fixed British "contextualise" → removed entirely.
- Self Portraits: removed clinical "These images use" opening; preserved the strong closing trio.
- Streets in Color: tightened the trailing preposition; clarified the color-as-composition idea.

---

## 2026-05-27 — Session 8

**Align intro text with photo left edge**

- `.num-row` first column changed from `auto` to fixed `200px` so alignment is predictable across all label lengths.
- `.project-body > p:first-child` given `margin-left: 224px` (200px col + 24px gap) to match photo left edge.
- Mobile override resets both to natural widths at ≤720px.

---

## 2026-05-27 — Session 7

**Fix photo label size mismatch; match gallery name to nav**

- `.img-caption` was being overridden to 18px by `.project-body p` (higher specificity); fixed by scoping to `.num-side .img-caption` — number and name now both render at 13px.
- `.project-header-title` bumped from 13px to 17px to match the nav links on the right.

---

## 2026-05-27 — Session 6

**Photo labels use gallery name + number on one line**

- Updated `.num-side` to `flex-direction: row` so number and name sit on one line (e.g., `01 Family`).
- Matched `.img-caption` font to `.seq-num`: both now 13px, weight 400, same tracking.
- Changed `.num-row` column from fixed `120px` to `auto` so longer names like "Streets in Color" don't overflow.
- Updated captions in all 5 project pages to use the gallery name instead of generic labels ("Home" → "Family", "Street" → "Streets in Color", etc.).

---

## 2026-05-27 — Session 5

**Reverted fullscreen gallery** *(reverts Sessions 3 & 4)*

- All 5 project pages restored to scrolling numbered-sequence layout. `gallery.js` removed. Gallery CSS removed from `styles.css`.

---

## 2026-05-26 — Session 4 *(reverted in Session 5)*

**Gallery bug fixes**

- Fixed arrows appearing above/below photo instead of on sides — missing `flex-direction: row` override on `.gallery-stage`.
- Added `FAMILY — 01 / 07` photo title label to gallery footer; `gallery.js` reads project name from `.project-header-title` so no per-page data needed.
- Updated footer HTML on all 5 project pages to new `gallery-photo-title` + `gallery-next` structure.

---

## 2026-05-26 — Session 3 *(reverted in Session 5)*

**Fullscreen gallery slideshow**

- Replaced scrolling numbered-sequence layout on all 5 project pages with a fullscreen slideshow: one photo at a time, fills the viewport (`object-fit: contain`), hard-cut navigation.
- Added `gallery.js`: shared script used by all project pages. Each page defines a `photos` array; handles prev/next, keyboard arrows, touch swipe, and preloads next image.
- Added gallery CSS to `styles.css`: `.gallery-view` body is a `100dvh` flex column, no scroll. Photo frame fills space between header and slim footer bar.

---

## 2026-05-26 — Session 2

**Project title consistency**

- Renamed "Portrait Photography" → "Studio Portraits" for consistency with "Self Portraits". Updated in `index.html` (projects array), `projects/studio-portraits.html` (title tag + header), and the "Next" link in `projects/family.html`. File renamed from `portrait-photography.html` to `studio-portraits.html`.

## 2026-05-26 — Session 1

**Code review + fixes**

- **CSS tokens corrected** (`styles.css`): `--bg` `#F0F0F0→#EEEEEE`, `--ink` `#000000→#151515`, `--muted` `#000000→#5a5a5a`, `--rule` `#000000→#c9c9c9`. Secondary text now has visible contrast against primary.
- **Deduplicated `.num-row` CSS**: Moved the numbered-sequence layout block from inline `<style>` tags in all 5 project pages into `styles.css`. Pages affected: `people-of-telegraph.html`, `family.html`, `portrait-photography.html`, `self-portraits.html`, `streets-in-color.html`.
- **Image files and folders renamed**: Replaced spaces with dashes across 4 folders and 21 files to match the dash-naming convention and avoid hosting reliability issues. Folders: `portrait photography→portrait-photography`, `self portraits→self-portraits`, `streets in color→streets-in-color`, `telegraph project→telegraph-project`. All `src` references updated in `index.html` and all project pages.
- **Lazy loading added**: `loading="lazy"` added to all 33 `.expandable` images across the 5 project pages.
- **Pre-launch to-do items added to `TODO.md`**: font decision (Archivo vs. Space Grotesk), About page content, portrait image, favicon, `<meta name="description">` on `about.html`, minor CSS and no-JS fallback notes.
